                    <p>Our pro photography team, led by internationally renowned automotive photographer, Kunal Kelkar, has set the bar extremely high for commercial automotive photography globally. <br>Photography is the backbone of our work at The Autofocus. We've spent years honing our skills in automotive, travel, landscape, portraiture, lifestyle, aerial and 360° photography. <br>Considering we are petrolheads it comes naturally to us to keep our photography style focused on automobiles. This has allowed us to carve a niche in the industry while amalgamating it with various subjects, people, studio setups and outdoor locations.
                        High-end Studio Photography has allowed us to be part of multiple high stake campaigns right from angle hunting exercises to ATL and BTL photo assets for various products before they hit the market.</p>

                    <p>As AI and creative tech progresses, we believe an amalgamation of photography and CGI is the way forward to achieve campaign goals smoothly and take the load off our clients. <br>CGI and CGI animation services provided by the autofocus are revolutionary for marketers and make it possible to mitigate unforeseen risks pertaining to creating content and drive sales. The basic challenge faced by automotive marketers are car availability and subsequent modifications in new models which are quite costly to shoot each time. Our CGI team helps you develop shoot scenarios and repurpose old CADs without actually needing the car in the actual shoot locations. <br>Whether it a simple sales explainer video or a complicated VFX animation. The Autofocus continues to deliver immersive content in new mediums and has the tenacity to push the limits every single time.</p>
